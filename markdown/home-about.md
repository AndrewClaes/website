The Antwerp-based multi-instrumentalist and polymath **Andrew Claes** has made a name for himself in recent years, particularly as the electric saxophonist of the instrumental jazz fusion band **[STUFF.](music-stuff.md)**

Graduating as a **[Doctor in the Arts](projects-jazzhands.md)** in 2023 and originally trained as a jazz saxophonist with specializations in electronic music composition and film scoring in 2006, he has never ceased to explore and study.

His insatiable curiosity led him to investigate the **influence of vibration on matter** with his 2010 research project **Cymatics** and later, in 2015, the **use of DIY electronics on stage (EOP).**

Through self-study during his doctoral research, he acquired basic skills in **electrical engineering, programming, PCB design**, and, more recently, **[live coding](music-livecoding)** techniques, for which he developed his own [unique environment](software-livecoding.md) with [open source software](https://www.bespokesynth.com).

Andrew is the inventor of the **[‘open hardware hybrid saxophone system’**](projects-hybridsax), transforming the saxophone into a **versatile MIDI controller.**

He played a pioneering role in the development of the **Live Electronics master's program** at the **Antwerp Conservatory** (2022), an innovative branch within the jazz department seeks to bridge the gap between jazz and classical musicians, creative coders, and other artistic performers. 
Andrew is currently on a teaching break, to devote more time exploring his artistic view. 

Beyond academia, Andrew is an active force in a diverse array of bands and projects, where his guiding principle—**"Unity in Diversity"**—always prevails over adherence to fixed styles, patterns, or conventions.

His sonic explorations can be heard in an impressive range of ensembles, including:

- **[Stellar Legions](music-stellarlegions.md)** – his own dub-infused space jazz formation
- **[STUFF.](music-stuff.md)** - jazz nuclear fusion outfit
- **[Arbeid Adelt!](music-arbeidadelt.md)** – hyperkinetic electronic body music (EBM)
- **[WITVROUW](music-witvrouw.md)** – swampy New Orleans blues
- **[Lucid Lucia](music-lucidlucia.md)** (formerly BRZZVLL) – futuristic jazz-fun
- **[Crazy Men](music-crazymen.md)** – a historical journey through Belgian fusion
- **[Hamster Axis of the One Clicked Panther](music-hamsteraxis.md)** - comrades in modern jazz since 2006
- **[Chaos of the Haunted Spire](music-chaos.md)** – an unhinged electro-free jazz duo
- **[Internal Sun](music-internalsun.md)** – his braindance project
- **[WingFi](music-wingfi.md)**- biweekly radio show with Dago Sondervan and guests @ Radio Centraal
- **[BotBop](music-botbop.md)** - algorithmic and AI driven live coding trio
- **[Voodoo Sessions](music-voodoo.md)** - musical encounters in Antwerp's finest jazz bar.

His latest solo endeavour, **[Plant Based Music](music-pbm.md)**, delves into the real-time sonification of living plants, crafting **meditative, almost shamanic audiovisual concerts.**

Andrew’s music has been released on an eclectic range of labels, including **Gondwana (UK), Deep Medi (UK), SDBanUltra, EMI, Starman, Bedrock (US), and Byte Progressive.**

He has collaborated with **Zach Danziger** (renowned American drummer) and **Owen Biddle** (bassist of _The Roots_), alongside **Adriaan Vandevelde (Pomrad),** under the name **[Aerobe.](music-aerobe.md)** Additionally, he co-mixed the last three STUFF. albums with colleague **Joris Caluwaerts.**

One of his most recent ventures is **[BOTBOP](music-botbop.md)**, a collaboration with **Dago Sondervan** and **Kasper Jordaens**, exploring creative applications of **AI and algorithmic music** in partnership with **BOZAR and the Sonar Festival (Spain).**

Andrew has also performed as a special guest with **Brussels Jazz Orchestra, electropop artist [STIJN](music-stijn.md), Belgian-Congolese icon Zap Mama,** and legendary **techno DJ [Marco Bailey](music-marcobailey.md).**

At just **17 years old**, he scored a modest club hit with **[Monastic Project](music-monasticproject.md).**

Now, **24 years and thousands of concerts and projects later,** he remains driven by an ever-evolving quest for both logical and unexpected interpolations across genres and disciplines.

These days, you can regularly find him performing **with fellow musician Fre Madou** in various adventurous lineups on **[Sunday evenings at Café Des Arts](music-voodoo.md)** in **Berchem**, where the stage often welcomes spontaneous cameos from luminaries such as **Mauro Pawlowski, Rudy Trouvé, Simon Lenski, Dre Pallemaerts, Eric Thielemans, and Bert Joris.**
