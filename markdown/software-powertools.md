Powertools is the name I use for various little Python scripts that I use on a daily basis.

Harnessing the power of AI assisted coding, I end up making little tools to automate cumbersome tasks.

Below is a list to my small one trick python scripts with some explanation.

Feel free to use this scripts and modify to your own needs!

Github users are invited to add features, that would be great :-)
