# Research

artistic research for the advancement of life.

You can find out about my current research projects [here](../pages/projects.html)

I'm interested in biofeedback systems, brainwave entrainment, data sonification.
I'm also working on hybrid instruments and computer aided, human centered applications.


I'm trying out simple tools for specific situations and building a library of small scripts to do tedious things for us.


Music, sound and rhythm have magical powers. Exploring this realm has been a real blessing for me and I'm very happy to share a collection of files on this topic on the pages of this site.
