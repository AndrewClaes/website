With the advent of AI assisted coding, 
a new world is opening up for me.
For the first time I'm able to create digital tools to the coding level.

This website is one of many projects and straightforward tools that make my life a lot easier.
Take a look, maybe you find a use for them too or maybe they spark your imagination to create your own!

My journey into coding began when I was introduced to [live coding](research-software-livecoding.md) by Dago Sondervan.
I was starting to get a bit into coding while working on the [HybridSax](research-hybridsax.md) project, doing mostly Arduino and some Python.

Python was lurking round the corner for some time, because I got into [Bespoke Synth](https//www.bespokesynth.com) a few months earlier. 
Bespoke Synth has a Python scripting interface allowing the flexible modular patching DAW to be scripted.
I created a Bespoke patch and matching script, creating a shorthand for writing musical code which proved suitable for live coding. Try it for yourself! [Bespoke Live Coding](research-software-livecoding.md) or check out some [videos](research-software.md)
