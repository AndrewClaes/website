Welcome to my personal website.


If you are browsing on a mobile device, please turn it in landscape mode and you'll be fine!


On these pages I want to share my [music](music.md), [projects](projects.md), [concerts](concerts.md) and interests.
If you like my content, please consider buying something on my [bandcamp](https://macro31.bandcamp.com).
All prices are on a pay what you want basis, except shipping costs.


Sit back, relax and take a deep breath.
No ads, no cookies, no tracking (at least not by me).
Enjoy your stay on a safe(r) space and I hope you find something you like.


Sincerely,
Andrew
